# IMG-BASE64-CONVERTER

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This project was designed to help me understand how base64 encoding and decoding works. I started this proect as a way of better understanding how the Ethscription protocol works, how files are decoded and still be decoded and read.

## HOW CAN I EXPERIMENT OR CONTRIBUTE TO THIS REPO?

You can simply get your hands on this file and start working with it. Here's how:

1.  Fork this repository
2.  Cloen it locally to your computer `git clone https://github.com/arewageek/img-base64-converter` (Change "arewageek" to your username if you did clone it)
3.  Cd into th directory you cloned it to `cd img-base64-converter`
4.  Replace the image in the images folder with yours and update the image name in the **index.py** file
5.  Open your terminal and run the script
    - If you're using vscode simply press `CTRL + J`
    - In your terminal type `python3 index.index.py` (Ensure you're in the right directory)
    - If you're using a different OS you would probably have to run `python index.py`
6.  Check the data folder to view the image decoded. Feel free to change the image type from png to whatever type you intend to work with.
7.  That should be all. Have fun eperimenting with this.

### IT WILL MEAN A LOT TO ME IF YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY TO THIS PROJECT. PERHAPS THIS COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACTUAL FILE CONVERTING SOFTWARE
